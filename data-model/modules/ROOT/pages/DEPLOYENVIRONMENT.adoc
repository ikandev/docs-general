=== Column Descriptions

[[_cd_deployenvironment_oid]]
==== OID 
(((DEPLOYENVIRONMENT ,OID)))  (((OID (DEPLOYENVIRONMENT)))) 
Unique table identifier.

See also: <<DEPLOYENVIRONMENT.adoc#_i_deployenvironment_deployenvironment_pk,DEPLOYENVIRONMENT_PK>>.

[[_cd_deployenvironment_sourcelocation]]
==== SOURCELOCATION 
(((DEPLOYENVIRONMENT ,SOURCELOCATION)))  (((SOURCELOCATION (DEPLOYENVIRONMENT)))) 
The path to the physical location where the unpacked build result is placed.

IKAN ALM adds the Deploy OID: SourceLocation/DeployOID

This location is passed to the Deploy Script as a parameter named source.

(For ANT, this is a property.)

[[_cd_deployenvironment_debug]]
==== DEBUG 
(((DEPLOYENVIRONMENT ,DEBUG)))  (((DEBUG (DEPLOYENVIRONMENT)))) 
Indication whether or not the Debug option is activated for the Deploy Environment.

If Debug is activated for a Deploy Environment, the Build Clean-up action will not be performed, so that the user may use the available build results to run the deploy script manually for testing purposes.

[[_cd_deployenvironment_partialdeploy]]
==== PARTIALDEPLOY 
(((DEPLOYENVIRONMENT ,PARTIALDEPLOY)))  (((PARTIALDEPLOY (DEPLOYENVIRONMENT)))) 
Indication whether the Partial Deploy option must be activated or not for this Deploy Environment.

If the option is activated, IKAN ALM will analyze the differences between the two build results on the IKAN ALM Server and only new and modified files will be transported to the Agent.

This is achieved as follows:

Both the newly compiled Build result and the base-line Build (the one the new Build results are compared with) are decompressed (unzipped).

The decompressed files are compared and the following actions are taken:

* Identical files are deleted and not deployed.

* Modified and new files (available in the new but not in the base-line

Build results) are transported.

* For deleted files (available in the base-line Build result, but not in the new one), dummy files with names in the format FileName. to_be_deleted are created. The Deploy Script must be written in such a way, that it deletes the matching files from the Deploy Environment`'s Source Location.
